title: My first week in Buffalo
categories: Life

Today marks one week since I got to Buffalo to start my PhD in Computer Science. It's been a fairly busy week so far with having to set up my apartment, space in the lab, and assorted orientation activities. 

But I did find some time to explore Elmwood Village, which is the neighborhood where I live. Ask anybody I know and they'll be able to tell you how little I enjoyed living in Buffalo the last time I was here (for my masters degree) but I've found several good coffee shops and places to eat around here. 

I do have some qualms about my apartment: the kitchen sink is comically small (I'm trying to make due with a dishbin on a rolling cart), the fridge is a bit too small so I can't food prep (I bought a second fridge), and the floors are uneven. I think I can make due but I'm hoping the first floor apartment will open up so I can move down. It is pretty easy to get to campus (only like 20 minutes), and this apartment is a really good deal, but I'm unsure if I can stay here for multiple years. I'll keep an eye out and hope a similar price apartment opens up at some point (even if that means the hassle of moving).
