Recently I've been trying to find my favorite coffee bean. Typically I buy these beans whole and grind them whenever I make myself a coffee. I'm lucky enough to live close to several stores that specialty coffee & tea shops such: Porto Rico Importing Company on Bleecker Street (established in 1907) and Mcnulty's Tea and Coffee on Christopher Street (established in 1895). From these stores I tried (in no particular order):

* French Roast Ethiopian Harrar
* New Orleans Coffee with Chicory
* Moca Java
* French Roast Mexican Altura Coatepec
* French Roast China Yunnan
* Porto Rico Importing's Cafe Blend
* Santo Domingo

I also tried a bunch of more commercial brands you can typically find in various supermarkets:

* Trader Joe's Medium Roast
* Trader Joe's Dark Roast
* Trader Joe's Bolivian Blend
* Kicking Horse Three Sisters
* Kicking Horse Kick Ass
* Kicking Horse Grizzly Claw
* La Colombe Corsica
* La Colombe Nizza
* La Colombe Monaco
* Santo Domingo Coffee
* Oslo Coffee Odin Espresso Blend

And I tried a few other ones:

* Kopi Luwak
* Kismet Coffee Dunewood Roast

So far my absolute favorite beans have been the French Roast Mexican Coatepec, but out of the ones from supermarkets I think the La Colombe Monaco or Kicking Horse Three Sisters or Grizzly Claw. These are good in a Moka Pot but for cold brew which uses a much higher amount of coffee at once I really like the trader joe's medium roast because it has a good flavor and a good price compared to the others.
