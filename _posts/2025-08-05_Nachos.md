One of the most fun and spontaneous things I did while in university was to drive with some friends was take a day trip from Vancouver, BC to Friday Harbor in the San Juan Islands. It was an entire day event leaving before 6 in the morning and arriving back in Vancouver close to 8pm. Getting up that early after a long week of school wasn't something I wasn't really looking forward to, but there I was outside my house waiting to get picked up. When the car pulled up it was two people I knew and two I had never met, and again I thought to myself: "what am I doing here?" As we set off, we all started talking and I ended up enjoying the company. The first stop post border was the Doughnut House in Anacortes Washington on the way to the ferry.
