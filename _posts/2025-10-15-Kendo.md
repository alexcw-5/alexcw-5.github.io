Recently, I started training in Kendo, which is a Japanese martial art. The closest equivalent to a western sport would be fencing, since both are "partner" sports in that you are playing with an opponent. However, Kendo uses bamboo *shinai*, which is a bamboo practice sword. Lots of things matter in Kendo tht I do not believe matter as much in fencing. For example, what side of the shinai you strike with matters, as well as the fact that you can only stike with a certain amount of the shinai, not the enitre thing.
