Recently, I started training in Kendo, which is a Japanese martial art. The closest equivalent to a western sport would be fencing, since both are "partner" sports in that you are playing with an opponent. However, Kendo uses bamboo *shinai*, which is a bamboo practice sword. Lots of things matter in Kendo tht I do not believe matter as much in fencing. For example, what side of the shinai you strike with matters, as well as the fact that you can only strike with a certain amount of the shinai, not the entire thing.

Also, the specific footwork and way you move is very very important. That is what has caused me the most issues, everything is much more specific than I am used to, and even though I think I'm doing it correctly, I always get called out for the way my feet are pointed not parallel, too close together, or that I'm using my right hand too much. But it's still fun and the people are nice, which adds to my social circle. The only thing that I would change is that practices end at 9 or 9:30pm and I live far from campus, so I get home late and eat even later. I do see myself doing this long term, and hopefully all the stuff I keep focusing on now will become second nature soon.
