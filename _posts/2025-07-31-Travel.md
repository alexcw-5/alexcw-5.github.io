Vancouver is a place a really miss and the more time that passes since I graduated from UBC and left, the more I miss it and want to move back. Hopefully I can find a way to move back, even if it means making less money it may help my happiness. I did enjoy the Camino as well, mostly due to the people I met along the way. I think if I had the chance I would do it again, but there are more places I want to visit before repeating a travel experience I've already had.
