title: What is a Tactical Yes?
categories: Logistics
---

I've been toying with what to call this concept in my head for a while. Its hard to describe and harder to sum up in two words, but I think a tactical yes is a good way to put it.

I'm not saying to blindly say yes to everything. First, I guarantee that there are many things that you will not want to do for whatever reason and it is totally valid to say no to those things. But I think there is a category of things that you want to say yes to, but hesitate for any number of reasons. I posit that in these cases you should say yes, you never know the outcome. If you get bored or decide that you don't wnt to be there then it is always possible to leave early, but if it goes well then you have a good memory which you can cherish forever.  

I'll give a few examples from the time I was doing my undergrad. The first time was to take a spot on a day trip with a friend of mine and a bunch of people that I didn't know. I had a bunch of work I could have been doing that day, and was kind of hesitant to go on a full day trip with a bunch of people I didn't (or barely) knew, especially because we were leaving at about 5:30 in the morning. But within half an hour we were all laughing and cracking jokes together. The whole trip was one of my favorite trips from that semester and I ended up doing it a few more times with varying groups of people.

The second time I used a tactical yes was one day when I was deciding weather to grind through another night of studying after several weeks of barely sleeping an not doing anything but work when a friend asked me if I wanted to grab dinner. For a little while I was debating back and forth about whether to say no because I had lots of work to do, but ended up saying yes thinking I was going to cut and run quickly to get back to work. But while there I realized how much I really needed a break so ended up taking the night off. It turned out to be a very good break and looking back it prevented me burning out.
